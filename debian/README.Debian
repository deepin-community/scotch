scotch for Debian
-----------------

Scotch provides a metis and parmetis interface which would allow one to compile
programs and libraries requiring metis whitout having to install parmetis
(which is a non-free software)

From release 6.1.1, the default Metis compatibility built into libscotchmetis.so
has been configured to Metis v5 (build flag -DSCOTCH_METIS_VERSION=5).
