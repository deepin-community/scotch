Description: programs and libraries for graph, mesh and hypergraph partitioning
 Its purpose is to apply graph theory, with a divide and conquer
 approach, to scientific computing problems such as graph and mesh
 partitioning, static mapping, and sparse matrix ordering, in
 application domains ranging from structural mechanics to operating
 systems or bio-chemistry.
 .
 The SCOTCH distribution is a set of programs and libraries which
 implement the static mapping and sparse matrix reordering algorithms
 developed within the SCOTCH project.
 .
 SCOTCH has many interesting features:
 .
 o Its capabilities can be used through a set of stand-alone programs
 as well as through the libSCOTCH library, which offers both C and
 Fortran interfaces.
 .
 o It provides algorithms to partition graph structures, as well as
 mesh structures defined as node-element bipartite graphs and which
 can also represent hypergraphs.
 .
 o It can map any weighted source graph onto any weighted target
 graph. The source and target graphs may have any topology, and their
 vertices and edges may be weighted. Moreover, both source and target
 graphs may be disconnected. This feature allows for the mapping of
 programs onto disconnected subparts of a parallel architecture made
 up of heterogeneous processors and communication links.
 .
 o It computes amalgamated block orderings of sparse matrices, for
 efficient solving using BLAS routines.
 .
 o Its running time is linear in the number of edges of the source
 graph, and logarithmic in the number of vertices of the target graph
 for mapping computations.
 .
 o It can handle indifferently graph and mesh data structures created
 within C or Fortran programs, with array indices starting from 0 or
 1.
 .
 o It offers extended support for adaptive graphs and meshes through
 the handling of disjoint edge arrays.
 .
 o It is dynamically parametrizable thanks to strategy strings that
 are interpreted at run-time.
 .
 o It uses system memory efficiently, to process large graphs and
 meshes without incurring out-of-memory faults;
 .
 o It is highly modular and documented. Since it has been released
 under the CeCILL-C free/libre software license, it can be used as a
 testbed for the easy and quick development and testing of new
 partitioning and ordering methods.
 .
 o It can be easily interfaced to other programs. The programs
 comprising the SCOTCH project have been designed to run in
 command-line mode without any interactive prompting, so that they can
 be called easily from other programs by means of system() or popen()
 calls, or piped together on a single command line. Moreover, vertex
 labeling capabilities allow for easy renumbering of vertices.
 .
 o It provides many tools to build, check, and display graphs, meshes
 and matrix patterns.
 .
 o It is written in C and uses the POSIX interface, which makes it
 highly portable. PT-SCOTCH uses the MPI interface, and optionally the
 POSIX threads.
